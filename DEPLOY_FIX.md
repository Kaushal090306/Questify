# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT FIX SUMMARY

## ❌ Issue: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pkg_resources'`

This error occurs because `djangorestframework-simplejwt` depends on `pkg_resources` from `setuptools`, which is not included in newer Python versions by default.

## ✅ FIXES APPLIED:

### 1. **Added setuptools to requirements**
- `requirements-deploy.txt` ← Added `setuptools>=65.0.0`
- `requirements-stable.txt` ← NEW: Ultra-stable version-pinned requirements
- `requirements.txt` ← Added setuptools

### 2. **Updated build commands**
- `render.yaml` ← Now installs `pip setuptools wheel` first
- `build.sh` ← Updated with setuptools
- Uses `requirements-stable.txt` for maximum compatibility

### 3. **Enhanced Procfile**
- Added worker configuration and timeouts for better performance

### 4. **Python version stabilized**
- `runtime.txt` ← Changed to Python 3.11.8 (more stable)

## 🔧 FILES TO COMMIT:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix pkg_resources error by adding setuptools"
git push origin main
```

## 🎯 DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY:

**Primary:** Use `render.yaml` blueprint deployment
**Backup:** Use `MANUAL_DEPLOY.md` instructions

## 📊 REQUIREMENTS HIERARCHY:

1. **requirements-stable.txt** ← RECOMMENDED: Version-pinned, most stable
2. **requirements-deploy.txt** ← Minimal with setuptools fix
3. **requirements.txt** ← Full development requirements

## ⚡ QUICK TEST:

Before deploying, test locally:
```bash
pip install -r requirements-stable.txt
python manage.py check --deploy
```

## 🚀 DEPLOY NOW:

Your app should now deploy successfully to Render! The setuptools error is fixed.

**Expected deploy time:** 3-5 minutes
**Services:** Backend + Frontend + Database
